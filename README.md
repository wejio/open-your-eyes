# open-your-eyes

You can view my first animation at https://wejio.github.io/open-your-eyes/

## Inspiration Started
After many tries to get interested in Sass (SCSS actually) I finally found a tutorial I liked. It was codeSTACKr's video on the freeCodeCamp.org
 channel that got me started.
 
Created my own version of his "portfolio-sass" project. Then saw Web Dev Simplified's video CSS animation in 15 minutes and Traversy Media's video CSS3 Animation & Transitions Crash Course. Just had to create an animation of my own.

## Resulting First Animation
A bit slow in the beginning but finally my eyes are opened ;-)
