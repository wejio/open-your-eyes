## About
This repo came about while trying to reconnect to CSS again. Last dive into design was CSS 2.1. I have used CSS, but mostly through frameworks and such. Always wanted to get proficient with the "new" grid, flex, animations and transitions. Also to master LESS or SASS. Unfortunally the day only had 24 hours, and I was unable to find a way in that suited me.

### Inspiration Started
After many tries to get interested in LESS or SASS (SCSS actually) I finally found a tutorial I liked. It was codeSTACKr's video on the freeCodeCamp.org
 channel that got me started. 
 
Created my own version of his "portfolio-sass" project. Then saw Web Dev Simplified's video CSS animation in 15 minutes and Traversy Media's video CSS3 Animation & Transitions Crash Course. Just had to create an animation of my own.

A bit slow in the beginning but finally my eyes opened and I created my first CSS animation ;-)

## Choice of LESS or SASS
SCSS was the clear choice for me. Now I'm off to start putting human web interfaces on some long overdue projects. Some of which will become public on GitHub.
